#2. Introduction 
 
The project is mainly a navigation real time system application that helps users to find a specific locations indoor and outdoor unlike GPS satellite navigation; which is outdoor. The idea is using the internet from phone and also WIFI. There is also a cool voice function for blind people. There are other functionalities and features as well.These features are email and eventnotifications, schedule, newsfeed and games. Those features are also interesting from the market perspective.

##Use case scenarios (based on template)
1. Open the phone
2. Open the app
3. Sign in as Guest or with account
3. Choose navigation
2. Choose your destination
3. Internet could fail, use internal GPS ( offline mode )
4. E-mail,alarm and other settings they will come acording to the significance and timing of course.
5. Generic user has reached the destination

#4.System architecture
##4.1 High-level overview of the system
Kana2.0 is a navigation app with more interesting features. The database is consisted of the whole school map. The app runs using the WIFI to detect the position of the user. It is an indoor GPS system.
###4.2 Main modules and their functions represented

#5. Requirements (in traceable (and measurable) format) - Sasha
##Functional requirements
##Non-functional system requirements
Usability: how do you ensure that your system is easy to use?
Reliability: how do you ensure that your system is reliable? List the possible system failures and how the system reacts to them
Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? What metrics would you use?
What other non-functional requirements should be documented?
What kind of metrics you should use to guarantee unambiguity?
 
#6. User interface - Masinde
##What are the views / components of the system? What are the functionalities of each view?
Illustrate each view and what it is used for (Textual explanation ok, no need for pictures!)

#User Interface

#1. login view
  * Username
  * Password
  * login button

#2. Menu 
 * navigation 
 * Schedule 
 * notification 
 * Events 
 * Voice guide 
 * news
 * Back 
 * Logout

#7. Project management, self reflection
#Working hours
       * Aleksandr Tikachev : 25 hours
       * Jeremy Kyejo :36 hours
       * Bilen Gerawork : 30 hours
       * Masinde Masinde : 25 hours
       * Zelalem Aragie :25 hours
 * It was difficult because in real work situation there is a person whose job is to right down the hours for you and moreover the person also notes down these working hours from start.
 *  We would take more time off from school (other courses) to concentrate on this kind of project.
 * We would definetly buy this product. I mean who wouldn't 
enjoy and have fun with this navigation service.
 * The most difficult part would be the requirements (functional and 
non functional) and system architecture.
