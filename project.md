Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? What metrics would you use?
What other non-functional requirements should be documented?
What kind of metrics you should use to guarantee unambiguity?

7. Project management, self reflection - Zelalem
 
List the realized working hours, that is, how many hours did this work really take. List the hours separately per person.
Was it difficult to estimate workload, how much the estimation differed from real working hours?
What would you do differently on the next project? Was your project success, would you buy your product?
What was the most difficult part in the documentation? Is there something that you were not satisfied with?
